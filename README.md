# RegressModel

RegressModel is a Python package designed for streamlined regression analysis. It facilitates the process of training and evaluating multiple regression models on a dataset, providing a comprehensive comparison of their performance. This package is particularly useful for data scientists and machine learning practitioners who need to quickly assess the best regression model for their specific data.

## Features

- Easy comparison of various regression models.
- Includes common models like Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, SVR, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost.
- Outputs performance metrics like R2 score, RMSE, MSE, MAE, and cross-validation scores.

## Installation

You can install RegressModel using pip:

```bash
pip install regressmodel
```
## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use RegressModel:

```bash
from regresseasy import reg_modelling
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Sample dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
X = df.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = df['target_column']

# Splitting the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Example usage of the function
# Ensure that you have defined X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test before calling this function
model_results = reg_modelling(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)

# # Access specific model results, e.g., Linear Regression
print("Linear Regression Results:", model_results["LinearRegression"])


# The results variable will contain performance metrics of the models
```
## Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
